/*
The debug malloc library also uses these environment variables:
 *  MALLOC_DUMP_LEAKS
        Trigger leak detection on exit of the program.
 *  MALLOC_TRACE
        Enable tracing of all calls to malloc(), free(), calloc(), realloc(), etc.
        A trace of the various calls is store in the file named by this variable.

    'MAP_ANON:
    This flag tells the system to create an anonymous mapping, not connected to a file. filedes and off are ignored, and the region is initialized with zeros.
    Anonymous maps are used as the basic primitive to extend the heap on some systems. They are also useful to share data between multiple tasks without creating a file.
    On some systems using private anonymous mmaps is more efficient than using malloc for large blocks.
    This is not an issue with the GNU C library, as the included malloc automatically uses mmap where appropriate.'
